# Data Structures and Algorithms

> When deciding on a data structure you must consider which one of the 4 main operations -- SEARCH, ACCESS, INSERT, DELETE -- you will be doing most often.

* O(1) => Constant Time; Always the same irregardless of input size
* O(n) => Linear Time; Increases proportionally as input size increases  
* O(log n) => Logarithmic Time; Halved with each iteration
* O(n^2) => Quadratic Time; Squared to the input size
